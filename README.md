# Group_Project_1

Deployed Page: https://srandle93.github.io/Group_Project_1/index.html

This project was our first group project that allowed each of us to create a website of our choosing.  We, as a group, decided to create a quiz game using OpenTrivia API. The goal was to use Robohash API to create an avatar, have log in uthentication using Firebase, and display a quiz that counts your score per question. If you get it right, your score goes up, otherwise it goes down.

Each team member worked on different aspects, but my main focus was to implement the Firebase authentication and to help with the question and answer logic.
